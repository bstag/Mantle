  "mission": "Product Name: Mantle\nTagline: The Identity Layer for Stagware.\nThe Concept\nMantle is an AI-powered brand identity engine designed for developers and founders who have built the \"muscle\" of their application (the code) but lack the \"coat\" to make it presentable. It moves beyond simple color pickers by generating a comprehensive, seasonally-aware \"Brand Bible\" based on a single mission statement.\nThe \"Stagware\" Philosophy\nMantle is built on a specific, cohesive metaphor that distinguishes it from generic design tools:\nThe Seasonal Hook: Just as a stag changes its coat for the season, modern applications must adapt to user preferences. Mantle doesn't just generate a palette; it generates a \"Winter Mantle\" (Dark Mode) and a \"Summer Mantle\" (Light Mode), ensuring the brand looks majestic in any environment.\nRegal Authority: The tool treats branding as an act of coronation. It creates \"Sigils\" (logos) and \"Crests\" (secondary marks) rather than just icons, instilling a sense of enterprise-grade authority.\nLayers: If the code is the skeleton and muscle, Mantle is the fabric draped over it—the Identity Layer."
